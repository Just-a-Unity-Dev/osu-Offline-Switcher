# How to use osu! offline switcher

Why does the switcher need administrator?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The switcher needs access to a specific rule that the app will add.

The switcher will enable or disable the rule that blocks osu!'s access to the internet, but 
it can't do so without administrator access.

HOW TO USE
------------------

-Open the .exe file "osuoffline.exe"

-Allow administrator privileges

-Press "Add Rule" button

-Find and select your osu!.exe file

-Press "Switch Mode" button to switch to offline/online mode

-Enjoy!

IMPORTANT
------------------

If you're paranoid that the rule created is correct, please check by checking the firewall itself.
Otherwise, you can start using the switcher.

More details in the section below.

HOW TO CHECK FIREWALL RULE
---------------------------

-Open windows firewall through control panel

-Press "Advanced Settings"

-Go to "Outbound Rules"

-If you see the rule "osuoffline", right click it and press "Properties"

-Once in "Properties", select "Programs and Services".

-You will see your directory in the "Programs" section. Check if this directory leads to your osu!.exe file.

-If it does lead to your osu!.exe file, then you are now allowed to use the switcher. Enjoy!
